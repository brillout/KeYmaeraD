 === Usage
-scala >=2.9 required (use of sys.process introduced in 2.9)
-export SPACEEX=/path/to/spaceex
-see Makefile for compiling and running

 === Notes
-this is a proof of concept, many details are not well written
-//{{{ and //}}} are vim fold markers

 === Limitations
modeling:
-only linear (SpaceEx only supports linear equations for now)
-not distributed, i.e. quantified assignements/differential_equations not supported
-no way found to support invariants/guards beeing hybrid systems, i.e. modalities in invariants/guards are not supported
-diamond hybrid program not supported
-existencial quantifier not supported
-formula in the form [hp]([hp1]f1 \/ [hp2]f2) not supported
proveness:
-SpaceEx's LGG scenario formally not sound
-SpaceEx only proves stable systems
platform:
-SpaceEx call-able via command line only on Linux/macOS (for Windows a virtual machine is needed)

 === Assumptions
inv_hints and sols parameters of Evolve and Loop are ignore-able, see types.scala
